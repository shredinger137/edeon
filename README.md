EdEon site built in Gatsby, sourcing from Wordpress. Currently configured to epo.sonoma.edu/dev, with images at epo.sonoma.edu/. Note that gatsby-node replaces relative image URLs with the full version explicitly. This will probably need to be changed in deployment, after the location of the admin site is established.
